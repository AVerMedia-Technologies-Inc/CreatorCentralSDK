## setWidgetSettings

The package and property view can save data persistently for the widget's instance using the setWidgetSettings event. Note that the property view will automatically receive a [```didReceiveWidgetSettings```](/EventsReceived.md#didReceiveWidgetSettings) event with the new settings. Similarly, the package will automatically receive a ```didReceiveWidgetSettings``` event with the new settings when the property view sends this event.

``` json
var json = {
    "event": "setWidgetSettings",
    "context": uniqueValue,
    "payload": {<json data>}
};
```

| Members | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| event | setWidgetSettings. |
| context | A value to identify the instance's widget or Property View. This value is received by the Property View as a parameter of the connectCreatorCentral function. |
| payload | A JSON object which is persistently saved for the widget's instance. |

## getWidgetSettings

The package and property view can request the persistent data stored for the widget's instance using the ```getWidgetSettings``` event.

``` json
var json = {
    "event": "getWidgetSettings",
    "context": uniqueIdentifier
};
```

| Members | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| event | getWidgetSettings. |
| context | A value to identify the instance's widget or Property View. This value is received by the Property View as a parameter of the connectCreatorCentral function. |

``` json
var json = {
    "widget": "com.avermedia.example.widget1",
    "event": "didReceiveWidgetSettings",
    "context": uniqueIdentifier,
    "payload": {
        "settings": {<json data>}

## setPackageSettings

The package and property view can use this event to save tokens that should be available to every widget in the package.

``` json
var json = {
    "event": "setPackageSettings",
    "context": uniqueIdentifier,
    "payload": {
        "settings": {<json data>}
    }

| event | setPackageSettings. |
| context | A value to identify the package or Property View. This value is received by the Property View as a parameter of the connectCreatorCentral function. |
| payload | A json object which is persistently saved and available to every widget in the package. |

Please keep in your mind: when the package uses this API, the Property View will automatically receive a ```didReceivePackageSettings``` callback with the new settings. Similarly, when the Property View uses this API, the package will automatically receive a ```didReceivePackageSettings``` callback with the new settings.
